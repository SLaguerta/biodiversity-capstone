# Biodiversity of National Parks
This is my Capstone Project for the Codecademy Data Analysis Pro Intensive Course. To fulfill the requirements of the course, I analyzed data Codecademy provided on animal species observed at various U.S. National Parks.

### Objectives
Skills tested in this project were:
* Data Visualization with Matplotlib
* Data Manipulation with Pandas
* Statistical Distributions with Numpy
* Hypothesis Testing with SciPy

### What's Inside?
* 2 .csv files
  * Provided by Codecademy 
* Jupyter Notebook
  * Text cells were written by Codecademy to guide analysis. Codecademy graded the code written in input cells, and outputs were used in the slide presentation.
* Slide presentation (.pdf)
  * Slide presentation was required for the project; it includes my analysis of the data.
